# Decentralized-control-and-Glover-McFarlane-Robust-Control-of-the-four-tank-process
Advanced control theory project, with the application of dynamic decentralized controller and Glover-McFarlane controller in the real four-tank process in both minimum phase case and non-minimum phase case.

Key words: modelling, manual control, decentralized control, robust control

This is the project finished in Hydro Environment Learning Lab at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. The project is part of the master course, Control Theory and Practiced Advanced course under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Elling W Jacobsen.

Abstract: 
This report is a summary of the experiment regarding the control of four-tank process, which can be shaped into minimum phase structure and non-minimum phase structure respectively. The first part of the experiment is concerning theoretical model specification as well as parameters calculations of the four-tank system. In the second experiment, decentralized control and Glover-McFarlane robust control were conducted for the system. Performance analysis was also done to further evaluate the differences between two different approaches.

For performance analysis we analysed the step response and behaviour after external disturbances. We found out that the Glover-McFarlane has robustified the controller as it supposed to since we get a stable and quite fast response to external disturbances. In contrast, for the minimum phase system the response with decentralized control was not asymptotically stable.

In all experiments we experienced that the non-minimum phase system is slower in step response and disturbance attenuation. This is due to the RHP zero which limits the bandwidth of the sensitivity.
